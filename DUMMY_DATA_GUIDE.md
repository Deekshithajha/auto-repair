## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If Dummy Data Doesn't Load**
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Ensure the development server is running properly
3. Verify that components are using the frontend dummy data
4. Check that all required dependencies are installed

### **If Components Show Empty States**
1. The dummy data is built into the components - no database required
2. Check that the component state is being set correctly
3. Verify that the useEffect hooks are running properly
4. Check for any TypeScript errors in the console

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Test All User Flows**: Go through each user type and test all features
2. **Customize Data**: Modify dummy data to match your specific needs
3. **Add More Scenarios**: Create additional test cases for edge scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger datasets if needed

## 🎉 Success Indicators
