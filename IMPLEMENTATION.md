# Mechanic Shop Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Security & Authentication
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Moved roles from `profiles.role` to separate `user_roles` table to prevent privilege escalation attacks
- Created `has_role()` security definer function for safe role checking
- Updated all RLS policies to use `has_role()` instead of direct role access
- Implemented role-based authentication with three methods:
  - **Customer**: Email + License Plate
  - **Employee**: System ID + Password  
  - **Admin**: System ID + Password

### 2. Database Schema Updates
#### New Tables
- `user_roles`: Secure role management (admin, employee, user)

#### Updated Tables
- `profiles`: Added `system_id`, `license_plate` fields
- `vehicles`: Added `owner_id`, `photos[]` array
- `tickets`: Added workorder fields:
  - `ticket_number` (unique, auto-generated: WO-00000001)
  - `primary_mechanic_id`, `secondary_mechanic_id`
  - `estimated_completion_date`, `expected_return_date`
  - `labor_hours`, `labor_cost`, `parts_cost`, `tax_amount`, `total_amount`
- `invoices`: Added `payment_status` (pending/paid/overdue/cancelled)

#### Database Functions
- `has_role(_user_id, _role)`: Security definer function for role checks
- `get_user_primary_role(_user_id)`: Gets user's highest priority role
- `generate_ticket_number()`: Auto-generates sequential ticket numbers

#### Triggers
- `set_ticket_number`: Auto-assigns ticket numbers on insert
- All existing triggers remain functional

### 3. Authentication Flow
#### Customer Login
1. Enter email address
2. Enter license plate number (verification)
3. System looks up user by license_plate
4. Authenticates with Supabase

#### Employee/Admin Login
1. Enter system ID (e.g., EMP-0001, ADM-0001)
2. Enter password
3. System looks up user by system_id
4. Authenticates with Supabase

### 4. Existing Features (Preserved)
- User dashboard with tickets, vehicles, invoices
- Employee dashboard with assignments, worklog, attendance
- Admin dashboard with full management capabilities
- Real-time notifications
- Photo uploads for vehicles and damage logs
- Service history tracking
- Customer profiles with legacy status tracking

## ⚠️ Security Notes
1. **Password Protection**: Enable leaked password protection in Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to: Authentication > Auth Providers > Email
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

2. **Email Confirmation**: Currently disabled for faster testing. Enable in production:
   - Go to: Authentication > Auth Providers > Email
   - Enable "Confirm email"

## 📊 Database Migration History
All migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` directory:
1. Initial schema setup (existing)
2. `20251004XXXXXX`: Security fix - user_roles table
3. `20251004XXXXXX`: RLS policy updates
4. Schema enhancements (workorder fields, system_id, license_plate)

## 🔐 RLS Policies
All tables now use `has_role()` function for security:
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Uses security definer to avoid infinite recursion
- Consistent across all tables

## 🚀 How to Test

### Demo Accounts
The system auto-provisions these demo accounts on first login:

**Customer**:
- Email: demo-customer@autorepair.com
- Password: demo123

**Employee**:
- Email: demo-employee@autorepair.com  
- Password: demo123
- System ID: (set after first login)

**Admin**:
- Email: demo-admin@autorepair.com
- Password: demo123
- System ID: (set after first login)

### Setting Up System IDs
After first login for employee/admin:
1. Admin logs in
2. Goes to Employee Management
3. Assigns system_id to employees (e.g., EMP-0001)
4. Employees can then login with system_id + password

### Setting Up License Plates
Customers can add license plates to their profile:
1. Login with email + password (first time)
2. Go to Vehicle Management
3. Add vehicle with license plate
4. System links license plate to profile
5. Next time can login with email + license plate

## ⏳ Remaining Implementation Tasks

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
```
POST   /api/workorders         - Create new workorder
GET    /api/workorders?status  - List workorders by status
PATCH  /api/workorders/:id     - Update workorder
POST   /api/workorders/:id/parts - Add parts to workorder
POST   /api/workorders/:id/damage - Add damage log entry
POST   /api/invoices/:id/generate - Convert workorder to invoice
GET    /api/admin/reports      - Generate reports
CRUD   /api/library-links      - Manage link library
```

### UI Enhancements Needed
1. **Employee Portal**:
   - Kanban board view (open/in-progress/closed columns)
   - Drag-and-drop ticket management
   - Parts and labor entry forms

2. **Customer Portal**:
   - Create workorder/quote wizard
   - Enhanced damage history view

3. **Admin Portal**:
   - Employee management interface
   - Reports dashboard with charts
   - Link library management

### Business Logic
- Tax calculation: parts taxed, labor not taxed
- Automatic customer notifications on status changes
- Expected return date tracking
- Standard services seed data (brake job, AC service, oil changes)

### Testing
Need unit/integration tests for:
- Role-based access control
- Workorder creation and assignment
- Invoice generation with tax calculations
- Damage log entries
- Authentication flows

## 📝 Development Notes

### Code Organization
- All authentication logic: `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
- Role-based forms: `src/components/auth/RoleBasedAuthForm.tsx`
- Dashboard components: `src/components/dashboard/`
- Shared components: `src/components/shared/`

### Environment Variables
No VITE_* env variables used. All Supabase config is in:
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

## 🔄 Migration Instructions

### Running Migrations
Migrations are automatically applied when changes are deployed. To manually verify:

```bash
# Check migration status in Supabase dashboard
# Go to: Database > Migrations

# All migrations should show "Applied"
```

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Roles data is preserved in both `profiles.role` and `user_roles`
2. Can temporarily revert RLS policies
3. Application will fall back to email/password login if system_id lookup fails

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test role-based authentication flows
2. **Short-term**: Implement Kanban board for employees
3. **Medium-term**: Build out API endpoints as edge functions
4. **Long-term**: Add comprehensive test suite
